MapReduce is a programming model for processing large data sets.
It is inspired by the map and reduce functions commonly used in functional programming.
The Map function applies a transformation to each element of a collection,
while the Reduce function aggregates the results.
MapReduce enables distributed computing across many machines.
This approach is widely used in big data processing, including log analysis and indexing.
