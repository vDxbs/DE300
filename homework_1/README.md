Run the Homework1 Jupyter Notebook.

It will output a few graphs that look at the distributions involving the number of seats, capacity, aircraft status and operating status. 

There will be side by side histograms that show the original, skewed distribution of seats and capacity. After the Box-Cox transform is applied, there will be a graph showing the new, less skewed distributions. 

In the final section there will be two graphs that relate the quartile of number of seats (SIZE) to operating status and aircraft status.
