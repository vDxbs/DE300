Homework #2 Healthcare Database

running dockerfile should run both part 1 and part 2. If mimic.db does not exist and the ADMISSION, D_ICD_PROCEDURES, DRGCODES, ICUSTAYS, PATIENTS, PRESCRIPTIONS, and PROCEDURES_ICD csv's are located in a Data folder, the part 1 code will create the mimic.db. 

hw2 holds all of the relevant code while hw2_2 just has the part 2 code
